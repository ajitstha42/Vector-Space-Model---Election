HTML_TAG_START -->We’re still waiting for high-quality polls fielded after the vice-presidential debate, but if you’re expecting a drastic shake-up in the race, don’t hold your breath. <a rel="external" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/us/elections/vice-presidential-debate-polls-vance-walz.html">History shows</a> vice-presidential debates have little to no impact, and it will be hard to disentangle any movement from other recent major events, like the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in the Southeast. There’s a decent chance that JD Vance and Tim Walz will see an increase in the share of voters who have an opinion on them, and perhaps even a boost to their favorability. But it’s unlikely the debate will have much effect on the numbers for Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, who remain in a close race.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --> <span class="update-date svelte-1wqiqg9"
